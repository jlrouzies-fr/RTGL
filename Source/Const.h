// used is clamped to what the GPU reports, see InitTextureCountMax() in
// TextureManager.cpp.
//
// 4096 was not enough once gzdoom-rt started precaching a level's actors: one
// material claims up to TEXTURES_PER_MATERIAL_COUNT (5) entries, so ~2100
// materials exhausted the array, 487 textures were dropped, and because the
// overflow is a Warning rather than an error the game carried on and drew its
// HUD as untextured blocks.
//
// It is a SESSION budget, not a per-level one: nothing is ever freed while a
// level changes, so a long session could reach the old ceiling with no
// precaching at all. Nothing needed regenerating for this -- the shaders declare
// `uniform sampler2D globalTextures[]` unbounded and index it with nonuniformEXT,
// and every index in ShaderCommonC.h is a full uint32_t with no bit packing.
